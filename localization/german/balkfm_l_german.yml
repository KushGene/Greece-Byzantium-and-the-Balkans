 # General Balkans Content
 je_balkfm_tax_reform: "Modernize Tax Codes"
 je_balkfm_tax_reform_reason: "A leftover from Ottoman rule, taxation remains heavily land-based with the heaviest burden falling on those who work the fields. While preferred by the nobility, this system serves only to hold [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting] back from its future."
 je_balkfm_land_reform: "Reform Ottoman Land Practices"
 je_balkfm_land_reform_reason: "As a result of centuries of stagnation under Ottoman rule, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is a rural nation, sometimes even aggresively so. Leaders have demanded that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] psuh forward efforts to raise the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] people from their rural stations."
 je_balkfm_civic_reform: "Establish a Civic Tradition"
 je_balkfm_civic_reform_reason: "Entrenched over the course of Ottoman rule, the landed gentry exploit the lack of constitutional structures to place persons friendly to them in power. This has resulted in rampant corruption at all levels of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] society."
 je_balkfm_brigandage: "Secure the Countryside"
 je_balkfm_brigandage_reason: "In the wake of the Greek War of Independence, bandits have terrorized the Balkan countryside outside of the reach of the both the Ottoman and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] governments. Across the region, people demand they be brought to justice."
 je_balkfm_state_reform: "Organize the Administrative State"
 je_balkfm_state_reform_reason: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] emerged from Ottoman tutelage with a state apparatus that can hardly be described as one. Reform-oriented leaders have demanded that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] implement reforms to ensure proper administration of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state."
 je_balkfm_economic_reform: "Organize the Economy"
 je_balkfm_economic_reform_reason: "As a result of centuries of contest by the major powers of history, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetNameNoFormatting] economy has lagged far behind its neighbors in development. With most of the country dominated by subsistence argiculture and noble estates, reformers aim to bring industry to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 je_balkfm_social_reform: "Initiate Social Reforms"
 je_balkfm_social_reform_reason: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting]s have long been isolated from the ideologies of the West, but with autonomy from the Ottoman state has come a wave of enlightened thought. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] scholars argue that the only way for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state to gain its footing is to embrace modern legal and social movements."

 # montenegro content
 je_balkfm_mon_prince_bishopric: "The Prince-Bishopric"
 je_balkfm_mon_prince_bishopric_reason: "To many, the country of Montenegro seems like a ghost from the distant past. With nation-states to the west and empires to the east, the small nation endures as a reminder of Europe's feudal past. The ascent of Petar II to the throne has finally heralded change in the Prince-Bishopric. Invigorated by the ideals of his father, Petar I, and by liberalism from the West, the young Bishop hopes to bring the light of modernity to Montenegro."

 je_balkfm_mon_societal_reform: "Prince-Bishopric: Societal Reform"
 je_balkfm_mon_societal_reform_reason: "Montenegro is dominated by its feudal station. In the foothills of the Black Mountain, the people practice the same agriculture that has been in place since the Byzantine times. Industry is totally absent and the peasantry remain tied to their lords and cheiftans. The Bishop hopes to elevate the country from this pitiful state."
 je_balkfm_mon_administration: "Prince-Bishopric: Administrative Reform"
 je_balkfm_mon_administration_reason: "The Prince-Bishop rules with absolute authority. However, there is little formal structure to the Montenegrin government. While the Bishop selects his ministers, there is no legal system to enforce standards of law and taxation with much of this being handled at the local level by chieftans and tribunals. Petar I's grand vision for Montenegro will never come to pass unless the country can first establish control over its own people."
 je_balkfm_mon_military_reform: "Prince-Bishopric: Military Reform"
 je_balkfm_mon_military_reform_reason: "The Montenegrin military can hardly be described as such. With the country trapped in its medieval condition, the state has no formal military units to call on for defense. Ottoman Viziers raid our border towns and the defense of the realm has fallen to tribal chiefs whose loyalty to the Bishop can be described as fractious at best. Montenegro's days are numbered unless it can find the strength to defend itself."
 je_balkfm_mon_benefactor: "In Search of a Benefactor"
 je_balkfm_mon_benefactor_reason: "Montenegro cannot hope to suvive should the Porte ever succeed in massing a coordinated attack on the small country. With neighboring Pashas threatening the security of our border towns, leaders have suggested that we seek the protection of the European powers. The court has recommended reviving our ancient alliance with Russia, while others have suggested that we seek warmer relations with our Austrian neighbors."

 je_balkfm_mon_black_mountain: "The Lands of the Black Mountain"
 je_balkfm_mon_black_mountain_reason: "Montenegro, named after the appearance of the mountain Lovćen, clings on by a thread. The Prince-Bishop controls the lands within "Old Montenegro," but the majority of the Montenegrin people live under the thumb of the Turks. Heavily taxed and abused, the Montenegrin Serbs dream of a day when they will be free of the burden of the Porte."

In many ways, the vicious frontier has preserved many of the pre-medieval customs of conflict and tribal rule. From slave raids to the taking of heads, the hinterlands between represent a bizarre holdover of tribalistic behavior to the outside world. Moreover, despite its control over the lands of "Old Montenegro," tribal leaders have balked at wholesale submission to the Bishopric."
