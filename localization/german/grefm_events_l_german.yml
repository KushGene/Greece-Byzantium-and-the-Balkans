With expenses mounting and their use in putting down rebellions, their presence wears on the Greek populace."

 grefm.143.d3: "Building on the initial discovery of the site by Minos Kalokairinos in the 1870s, a team has uncovered an enormous throne room at the heart of a Bronze Age Palace. Further work has uncovered the sprawling remains of palace complex and ancient urban site.U ntil the formal excavations at Knossos, the role of Crete in the Minoan civilization was unclear. With the discovery of the palace complex, the city's position at the heart of the Minoan Civilization has been confirmed."
 grefm.143.t4: "Minoan Palace Restored"
 grefm.143.d4: "With the aid of Englishman Arthur Evans, laborers have completed an extensive reconstruction of the palace and its associated buildings. Several chambers and frescoes have been painstakingly rebuilt, with artisans blending the modern repair work with the ancient aesthetics. While impressive, the "reconstitution" of the palace attracted criticism with many arguing that Evan's "artistic license" has created a misleading representation of the past."
 grefm.143.t5: "Citadel of Gla Excavated"
 grefm.143.d5: "The Ephor overseeing activities at the Gla site has reported the completion of a comprehensive detailing of the site. Excavations of several buildings at the site have shown that Mycenaean architecture was already beginning to resemble that of Classical Greece. The ancient citadel sprawls across an outcrop that juts far into former Lake Kopais. Measuring larger then the footprint of ancient Athens, the site is defined by two major features: a palace-like structure in the north and two warehouse-like structures in the south. Scholars have theorized that the entire site may have served as a temporary shelter in times of war or hardship."
 grefm.143.t6: "Delos Surveyed"
 grefm.143.d6: "Situated amongst the Cyclades, Delos was the mythological core of the Aegean Sea. With the island abandoned since Byzantine times and managed only by a small caretaker population, the "excavations" at Delos have been more of just an accounting of the various structures located at the site. Several temples and social centers survive in remarkable condition."
 grefm.143.t7: "Larissa Surveyed"
 grefm.143.d7: "While several Greek cities have been abandoned over the years, some, like Larissa have been in continuous use, with medieval and modern buildings coexisting with archaic structures.

As lists are distributed to local officials, the hope is that urban planners can avoid disruption of known ancient sites."
 grefm.143.t8: "Rhodes Surveyed"
 grefm.143.d8: "Inhabited since the time of Mycenaneans, Rhodes has been ruled by the Greeks, Byzantines, Knights Hospitaller, and the Ottomans. Alongside that came populations of Jews, Pagans, Christians, and Muslims, giving the island an incredible variety of culutral influences. However, despite the numerous finds, the supervising ephor was disappointed to announce that no signs of the fabled Colossus of Rhodes have been found."

 grefm.144.t4: "Workshops of Thebes Excavated"
 grefm.144.d4: "Ephors have announced the completion of their massive effort to locate and catalogue the numerous small ruins throughout Thebes. In the Byzantine era, many of these buildings served as the beating heart of the Byzantine silk industry."
 grefm.144.t5: "Nicomedia Surveyed"
 grefm.144.d5: "Through a mixture of public surveys and private reporting, ephors have detailed a series of reports showing the extensive Roman history of the city. The expansivness of the ruins have made it difficult to tell where ancient ruins end and modern city begins."
 grefm.144.t6: "Smyrna Surveyed"
 grefm.144.d6: "Ephors have announced the conclusion of their survey of the extensive ruins in Smyrna. The city competed for "second city" status compared to Constantinople in the Byzantine era and researchers have recovered thousands of artifacts definitively dated to this flourishing phase of Smyrnite history."
 grefm.144.t7: "Tyana Excavated"
 grefm.144.d7: "While Tyana was lost to Turkic invasion early in their conquest of Anatolia, this fact hasn't stopped ephors from identifying hundreds of ruins in the old city."
 grefm.144.t8: "Chios Surveyed"
 grefm.144.d8: "Ephors have announced the completion of their survey of the island of Chios. Several ruins have been identified that have secured the island's status as a strategic holding during the Roman era and its subsequent occupation by the Genoese before falling into Ottoman control."

While their rights have waxed and waned between Venetian and French rule, their condition has undoubtely deteriorated under the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetPowerBloc.GetName]. With sanction from the outgoing administration in London, the colonial administration has excluded them from holding public office or from fair use of the court system."
 grefm.410.f: "Judaism, while not outright discriminated in the law, is in effect relegated to second-class status, with the Ionian constitution, classifing all non-Orthodox, non-Catholic faiths was merely "tolerated."

As a means of advocating for Jewish rights, he has begun publishing a journal, "Israilitika Chronika," which has harshly criticized the status of Jews under the colonial administration. This has served to drag the private process of seeking redress for discrimination out into the open for the citizenry to see."
 grefm.412.f: ""Only one number of this journal has appeared and although there is nothing in it which would offend the most sensitve Christian opposers of them and their religion, still a Jewish newspaper was a novelty displeasing to the ignorant and narrow minded amongst the Greek Christians." -Lord High Commissioner Henry Storks"

 grefm.835.f: "Under the hot summer sun, a fell spirit swept across the Hippodrome as the teams lined up for the quadrennial races.

Emblazoning their vehicles with brightly colored logos and sigils, the racers appear to have attempted to make this a motorized equivalent to the chariot race."
 grefm.838.f: "Despite the lack of organized planning, these hooligans have taken to informal sports such as drag racing and power pulling. Several onlookers have even suggested that these sports be formalized, with the most idealistic even suggesting that smaller vehicles, perhaps derived from gas-driven lawnmowers, could take to the track. Elites, however, decry this dangerous activity and have voiced dismay at the risks of damaging the ancient circus."

Beneath the imposing presence of the [SCOPE.sBuilding('hagia_sofia_scope').GetName], the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has been adorned with the old sigils and regalia of the Eastern Roman emperors and a resplendent robe of Emu down. Stepping forward towards the array of citizens, dignitaries, and clergy, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] stands as a beacon for the future of the [GetCulture('emu').GetName] state."
 grefm.891.f: ""If we had a military division with the bullet-carrying capacity of these birds it would face any army in the world ... They can face machine guns with the invulnerability of tanks. They are like Zulus whom even dum-dum bullets could not stop." -Major G. Meredith, 1932"

 grefm.893.f: "They said she was cactus, that nobody could raise the Imperial banner. They said the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] was dead-set drongo for getting us into a scrap over these forsaken lands. Hard yakka it was sure, but you can't lie that's a ripper flag flapping over the Bosphorus."
 grefm.893.a: ""Good on 'ya mate!""
